### What is IDCamPro <a href="#what-is-idcampro" id="what-is-idcampro"></a>

IDCamPro is a software for recording finish-line images as a backup - not only when a transponder tag is not read properly but also on regular finishes. Whenever a lightbeam or a transponder occurs on the finish-line a recording is triggered. These recorded images are augmented with time of day information as well as bib number.

### Feature Overview <a href="#feature-overview" id="feature-overview"></a>

The following features are currently available:

* Recording images from one or more sources (IP cameras like Axis or Hikvision, NDI, Blackmagic Design, Webcams, GoPros, ...) - only AXIS is fully supported
* Taking impulses and passings from one or more timing devices (ALGE-Timing, RaceResult, TagHeuer)
* Search for timestamps and bibs easily
* Export all images with bib markers at once for e.g. display on websites
