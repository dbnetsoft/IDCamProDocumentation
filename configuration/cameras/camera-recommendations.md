# Camera Recommendations

[Axis Communications](https://www.axis.com/) cameras are recommended to be used for IDCamPro. Benefits are

* Weather-proof
* MJPEG and H.264 support
* Some models support changeable lenses
* Integration with [CamStreamer](https://camstreamer.com/)
* Many more features



## Considerations

Full-HD resolution (1920x1080) is more than enough usually - higher resolution casues more CPU or network load and may not be working on smaller sized laptops.&#x20;

Standard framerate of 25/30 Hz is enough (50/60 Hz are fine as well) - no need for higher framerates.

## Housing

Some of the cameras can also be bought without housing (without -LE in model description) and are then not water-proof. But you can buy a custom house from ALGE-Timing [WP-IDCAM](https://alge-timing.com/en/product/2312/wp-idcam) that can help.
