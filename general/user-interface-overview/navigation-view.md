Navigation view allows to [navigate](../../competitions/navigation/) to points in time or events by clicking oin any [marker](../../competitions/markers-and-recordings.md).&#x20;

Matching markers for the selected time have a checkbox at the right hand side.&#x20;

When new recordings are done, there are three options what to do in terms of navigation:&#x20;

1. Do nothing - just record the frames, but stay on the selected time
2. Follow the new recording and jump to the first frame of the new recording
3. Same as 2, but only do this once and then stay at the new recording's selected time
