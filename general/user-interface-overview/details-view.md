Details view shows the selected time at the bottom center. Time can be selected by either clicking on any marker (bib, record) or recording in the [navigation view or via keyboard shortcuts](../../competitions/navigation/).&#x20;

[Markers ](../../competitions/markers-and-recordings.md)cannot be directly assigned to a image, but any amount of markers can be [matched ](../../competitions/matching-between-images-and-markers.md)onto the selected time and displayed. To the left of the selected time one can see the matching record markers, to the right are the matching bib markers.&#x20;
