# Live View

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt="" width="252"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Live view shows a preview of the latest received image from the camera. The view is not refreshed in real-time but only each second (can be changed in `?` - `Extended Settings` - `FrameLoadInterval`).&#x20;

The framerate is displayed at the top of the view and should never drop below 10 frames per second.&#x20;

In the lower right corner you can adjust the offset between image's time and timing system time (see [synchronisation](../../competitions/synchronisation.md)).&#x20;
