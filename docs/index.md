# Introduction

## What is IDCamPro

IDCamPro is a software for recording finish-line images as a backup. Whenever a lightbeam or a transponder occurs on the finish-line a recording is triggered. These recorded images are augmented with time of day information as well as bib number. 

## Feature Overview

The following features are currently available: 

* Recording images from one or more sources (IP cameras like Axis or Hikvision, NDI, Blackmagic Design)
* Taking impulses and passings from one or more timing devices (ALGE-Timing, RaceResult, TagHeuer)
* Search for timestamps and bibs easily
* Export all images with bib markers at once for e.g. display on websites
