# Competitions

All images from cameras and timing information from timing systems are stored inside what is called a "competition".&#x20;

A competition is a file with an `.competition` extension and usually resides in a folder called `Competitions` in the user settings location:  `%localappdata%\dbnetsoft\IDcamPro\Competitions`

## Backup

You can backup competition files simply by copying them away to another location. You can either copy it back and overwrite the original one or simply load the backup location file.&#x20;

## Deletion

Competition files can become quite large depending on the number of cameras used, the framerates and the number of recordings. If you do not need a file anylonger you can just delete it.&#x20;
